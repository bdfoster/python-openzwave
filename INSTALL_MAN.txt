Manual installation instructions
********************************

If you can't build python-openzwave using other instruction you can
try to install it using this method.


Install the needed tools
========================

You must install mercurial and subversion to get sources of python-
openzwave and openzwave. Look at the documentation of your Linux
distribution to do that.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install mercurial subversion python-pip python-dev

You need cython (0.14) to compile the python library
(libopenzwave.pyx). Some users have reported errors when using 0.16 or
0.17. Some 64 bits users reports segfault when using examples. Seems
that using cython 0.15 was the problem. Gentoo users : don't use
cython that is shipped with your distribution.

Install it using pip.

   sudo pip install cython==0.14

You also need some python modules, on a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools python-louie

You need sphinx and make to generate the documentation.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install python-sphinx make

You also need to install some sphinx contributions :

   sudo pip install sphinxcontrib-blockdiag sphinxcontrib-actdiag
   sudo pip install sphinxcontrib-nwdiag sphinxcontrib-seqdiag

To compile the openzwave library, you need the common builds tools and
the libudev developments headers.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev g++


Get sources of python-openzwave and open-zwave
==============================================

You are now ready to download sources of python-openzwave :

   hg clone https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/

Go to the python-openzwave directory and grab the sources of openzwave

   svn checkout http://open-zwave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openzwave


Build openzwave and python-openzwave
====================================

Go to the openzwave directory and build it :

   cd openzwave/cpp/build/linux
   make
   cd ../../../..

Build python-openzwave

   python setup-lib.py build
   python setup-api.py build


And install them
================

   sudo python setup-lib.py install
   sudo python setup-api.py install
