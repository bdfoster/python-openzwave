Installing python-openzwave from repositories
*********************************************


Install the needed tools
========================

You need cython (0.14) to compile the python library
(libopenzwave.pyx). Some users have reported errors when using 0.16 or
0.17. Some 64 bits users reports segfault when using examples. Seems
that using cython 0.15 was the problem. Gentoo users : don't use
cython that is shipped with your distribution.

Install pip

   sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev

And use it to install cython.

   sudo pip install cython==0.14

You also need some python modules, on a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools python-louie

To compile the openzwave library, you need the common builds tools and
the libudev developments headers.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev g++ make
