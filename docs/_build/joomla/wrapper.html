<dd><p>The purpose of this wrapper is to eliminate some of the tedium of working with
the underlying API, which is extremely fine-grained.</p>
<p>Wrapper provides a single, cohesive set of python objects representing the
current state of the underlying ZWave network.  It is kept in sync with OZW and
the network via callback hooks.</p>
<p>Note: This version only handles a single Driver/Controller.  Modifications will
be required in order to support more complex ZWave deployments.</p>

<p>A Python Singleton mixin class that makes use of some of the ideas
found at <a class="reference external" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonSingleton">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonSingleton</a>. Just inherit
from it and you have a singleton. No code is required in
subclasses to create singleton behavior &#8211; inheritance from
Singleton is all that is needed.</p>
<p>Singleton creation is threadsafe.</p>
<p>USAGE:</p>
<p>Just inherit from Singleton. If you need a constructor, include
an __init__() method in your class as you usually would. However,
if your class is S, you instantiate the singleton using S.getInstance()
instead of S(). Repeated calls to S.getInstance() return the
originally-created instance.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>class S(Singleton):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>def __init__(self, a, b=1):</dt>
<dd>pass</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>S1 = S.getInstance(1, b=3)</p>
<p>Most of the time, that&#8217;s all you need to know. However, there are some
other useful behaviors. Read on for a full description:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Getting the singleton:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>S.getInstance()</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>returns the instance of S. If none exists, it is created.</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p class="first">The usual idiom to construct an instance by calling the class, i.e.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>S()</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>is disabled for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p>For one thing, the S() syntax means instantiation, but getInstance()
usually does not cause instantiation. So the S() syntax would
be misleading.</p>
<p>Because of that, if S() were allowed, a programmer who didn&#8217;t
happen to notice the inheritance from Singleton (or who
wasn&#8217;t fully aware of what a Singleton pattern
does) might think he was creating a new instance,
which could lead to very unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>So, overall, it is felt that it is better to make things clearer
by requiring the call of a class method that is defined in
Singleton. An attempt to instantiate via S() will result
in a SingletonException being raised.</p>
<p>3) Use __S.__init__() for instantiation processing,
since S.getInstance() runs S.__init__(), passing it the args it has received.</p>
<p>If no data needs to be passed in at instantiation time, you don&#8217;t need S.__init__().</p>
<p>4) If S.__init__(.) requires parameters, include them ONLY in the
first call to S.getInstance(). If subsequent calls have arguments,
a SingletonException is raised by default.</p>
<p>If you find it more convenient for subsequent calls to be allowed to
have arguments, but for those argumentsto be ignored, just include
&#8216;ignoreSubsequent = True&#8217; in your class definition, i.e.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>class S(Singleton):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>ignoreSubsequent = True</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def __init__(self, a, b=1):</dt>
<dd>pass</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>5) For testing, it is sometimes convenient for all existing singleton
instances to be forgotten, so that new instantiations can occur. For that
reason, a forgetAllSingletons() function is included. Just call</p>
<blockquote>
<div>forgetAllSingletons()</div></blockquote>
<p>and it is as if no earlier instantiations have occurred.</p>
<p>6) As an implementation detail, classes that inherit
from Singleton may not have their own __new__
methods. To make sure this requirement is followed,
an exception is raised if a Singleton subclass includ
es __new__. This happens at subclass instantiation
time (by means of the MetaSingleton metaclass.</p>
