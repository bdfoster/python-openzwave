<h2>How to develop patches</h2>
<p>Get the sources</p>
<blockquote>
<div>hg clone <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/">https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/</a></div></blockquote>
<p>Developp, test, debug, test, ... :)</p>
<p>When your modification is functional, you are ready to submit a patch</p>
<p>Sync you repository :</p>
<blockquote>
<div>hg pull
hg update</div></blockquote>
<p>Generate the patch</p>
<blockquote>
<div>hgdiff &gt; somewordstoexplainwhatthepatchdoes.patch</div></blockquote>
<p>As the code of python-openzwave is under developpment, submit atomic patches.
Otherwise, you should have merge problems when syncing your repository.</p>
<p>This will generate a file in the current directory.
Send it to the developpers team.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation is managed with sphinx. Don&#8217;t utpdate txt files (README, INSTALL, ...)
, update the sources (<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>.rst) in docs. Use the following commands to generate
all docs files (txt, html and joomla)</p>

<h2>Packagers</h2>
<p>If you want to package python-openzwave for your distribution,
look at the make_dist.sh script. It build a distribution directory
with documentation in build/distdir.</p>
<p>You can also submit your script here, they will be added to the main code.</p>
<p>You can build python-openzwave using</p>

<div class="section" id="static-vs-dynamic-or-shared">
<h2>Static vs dynamic (or shared)</h2>
<p>The openzwave (c++) lib needs to run as a singleton : it means that it
MUST have only one instance of the manager running on your computer.</p>
<p>There is 2 ways of linking libraries with a program :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>static : includes a copy of the library in your binary program. This means</li>
</ul>
<p>that your program has its own instance of the library. This the way the
install.sh runs. So you CAN&#8217;T have another program (like the control-panel)
running when using the python-openzwave library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>dynamic or shared : includes a link to the library in your binary program.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that your program share the library with other programs. In this
case, the instance is owned directly by the library. This the way the
debian package works. So you CAN have another program running when
using the python-openzwave library. Of course, this program MUST use
the shared library.</p>

The openzwave package is now a wrapper to access Nodes, Network, Scenes, ...
To update your old code, change &#8220;import openzwave&#8221; by
