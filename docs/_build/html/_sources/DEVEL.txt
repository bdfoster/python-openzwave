How to develop patches
======================

Get the sources

    hg clone https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/

Developp, test, debug, test, ... :)

When your modification is functional, you are ready to submit a patch

Sync your repository :

    hg pull https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/

    hg update

Generate the patch

    hg diff > somewordstoexplainwhatthepatchdoes.patch

As the code of python-openzwave is under developpment, submit atomic patches.
Otherwise, you should have merge problems when syncing your repository.

This will generate a file in the current directory.
Finally post it on issues projets : https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/issues/list .

Using a developper account
==========================

Contact the developpers for more informations.

Documentation
=============

Documentation is managed with sphinx. Don't utpdate txt files (README, INSTALL, ...)
, update the sources (*.rst) in docs. Use the following commands to generate
all docs files (txt, html and joomla)

    ./make_docs.sh

Packagers
=========

If you want to package python-openzwave for your distribution,
look at the make_dist.sh script. It builds a distribution directory
with documentation in build/distdir.

You can also submit your script in issues, it will be added to the main code.

On Debian/ubuntu you can build python-openzwave using : 
    
    dpkg-builpackage 

Static vs dynamic (or shared)
=============================

The openzwave (c++) lib needs to run as a singleton : it means that it
MUST have only one instance of the manager running on your computer.

There is 2 ways of linking libraries with a program :

    * static : includes a copy of the library in your binary program. This means
    that your program has its own instance of the library. This the way the
    install.sh runs. So you CAN'T have another program (like the control-panel)
    running when using the python-openzwave library

    * dynamic or shared : includes a link to the library in your binary program.
    This means that your program share the library with other programs. In this
    case, the instance is owned directly by the library. This the way the
    debian package works. So you CAN have another program running when
    using the python-openzwave library. Of course, this program MUST use
    the shared library.

Migrate from py-openzwave to python-openzwave
=============================================

Remove the old py-openzwave

    find /usr -iname openzwave.so

This command show the list of files naming openzwave.so in /usr, ie /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-package/openzwave.so

Remove it :

    sudo rm /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-package/openzwave.so

Install the new version of python-openzwave : look at README

Update your code :

Everywhere in your code replace :

    "import openzwave" to "import libopenzwave" "from openzwave" to "from libopenzwave"

notifications :

In Maarten py-openzwave librairy, value is a string but in python-openzwave, it's a value of the right type :

    # 'value' : value.c_str(),

    'value' : getValueFromType(manager,v.GetId?()),

wrapper : The wrapper is no longer supported.
Now high level acces to ZWave network is provided by the API (work in progress)
