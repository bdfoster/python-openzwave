 this package, is Copyright (C) 2009 by:

  * Dr. Craig A. Counterman, whose code is used in "precess.c".
  * Robert Berger (N3EMO), whose code is used in "earthsat.c".
  * Elwood Charles Downey, who, with the permission of those earlier
    authors, wrote the rest of "libastro" thereby creating a derived
    work which he distributes with his "XEphem" application.
  * Brandon Craig Rhodes, who lightly modified some sections of the code
    to make them behave when run under Python within PyEphem.
